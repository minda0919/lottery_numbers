# To do/include:
# 1. *Randomly generate 6 numbers from 1-49
# 2. *Numbers don't repeat
# 3. *Don't include numbers that appeared in last draw
# 4. *Users can do multiple draws at once
# 5. *Upload to GitHub with README
# 6. Machine learning model to predict next numbers



# Pseudocode:

# Function to generate lottery numbers
gen_lotto_nums:
	Create variable num_draws and set it to the number of draws specified by user

	Create empty variable all_draws to store the current set of draws

	FOR the specified number in num_draws:
		Create empty variable current_draw to store the current draw

		IF current draw is the first one:
			Create empty variable last_draw to store the previous draw's numbers

		Create variable num_pool that contains numbers from 1 to 49

		IF last_draw is NOT empty:
			Remove numbers in last_draw from num_pool

		Randomly generate 6 nonrepeating numbers from num_pool and set current_draw to that list of numbers
		Set last_draw to current_draw
		Add current_draw to all_draws
		
	Return all_draws

# TO BE ADDED LATER
# Function to predict next winning numbers
# predict_lotto_nums:	
# Ask user if they want to generate lottery numbers or predict the next winning numbers
# Run the corresponding function

Run gen_lotto_nums
